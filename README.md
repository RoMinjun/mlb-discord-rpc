## Overview
**mlb-discord-rpc** shows live Major League Baseball game updates as your Discord status. It uses Discord Rich Presence to display real-time scores, game status, and player info for your favorite team while you use Discord. When no live game is detected, it displays the upcoming matchup with your opponent's logo and shows the score from the previous game. The large and small image tooltips include each team's winâ€“loss record. Pre-game statuses now also show the scheduled start time. Live game updates display the current ball and strike count for the batter only during active half-innings, and show which players are up next between innings.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
This project requires the following dependencies:
* **Programming Language:** Python (3.9+)
* **Package Manager:** Pip

### Installation
Build mlb-discord-rpc from the source and install dependencies:
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/RoMinjun/mlb-discord-rpc
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```sh
   cd mlb-discord-rpc
   ```
3. **Install the dependencies** using pip (Python 3):
   ```sh
   python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Usage
Run the project with Python 3:
```sh
python3 mlb-discord-rpc.py --team TOR
```
Or make it executable on Linux:
```sh
chmod +x mlb-discord-rpc.py
./mlb-discord-rpc.py --team TOR
```

---

## Options & Configuration
You can configure **mlb-discord-rpc** via command-line options, a `config.toml` file, and environment variables (`.env` file).

### Command-Line Arguments
* `--team <TEAM_ABBR>`
  **(required)** Sets your favorite MLB team by its abbreviation (e.g., `LAD`, `TOR`, `CHC`, etc.).
* `--tz <TIMEZONE>`
  Override the detected local timezone. Use [IANA timezone names](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones) (e.g., `America/Toronto`).
* `--live-only`
  Only show your Discord status when your team has a live game.

**Example:**

```sh
python script.py --team TOR --tz America/Toronto --live-only
```

---

### (Optional) Configuration File: `config.toml`

You may also set options persistently by editing (or creating) a `config.toml` file in the project directory.
Example:
```toml
team = "TOR"
timezone = "America/Toronto"
live_only = true

[display]
base_icon_filled = "ðŸŸ¦"
base_icon_empty = "âšª"

[refresh]
live_interval = 15
idle_interval = 90
```

* `team` - Team abbreviation (required)
* `timezone` - IANA timezone string (optional)
* `live_only` - Only display presence when game is live (optional)
* `[display]` - Customize base icons
* `[refresh]` - Customize update intervals in seconds

On some Linux setups the emoji base icons may appear as boxes. Install a color
emoji font like **Noto Color Emoji**, or set `base_icon_filled` and
`base_icon_empty` to plain ASCII characters.

---

### Environment Variables (`.env`)

* `CLIENT_ID`
  Your Discord application's client ID. **Required** to connect to Discord RPC.

Example `.env`:

```
CLIENT_ID=your_discord_client_id_here
```

---

## Quick Start

1. Set your `CLIENT_ID` in `.env`.
2. Optionally configure your team and preferences in `config.toml`.
3. Or run directly with command-line options.

### Running on Linux
Install Python 3 and pip using your package manager (example for Ubuntu/Pop!_OS):
```sh
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip
```
After installing the dependencies with `python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`,
ensure the Discord client is running and start the script as shown above.

### Running on Windows
Install [Python 3 for Windows](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/). When installing,
make sure to check **"Add python.exe to PATH"**. Open **Command Prompt** or **PowerShell** and run:
```cmd
py -3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
py -3 mlb-discord-rpc.py --team TOR
```

**Enjoy seamless MLB presence on Discord!**
